# David Chu's Restaurant Bistro

## Overview

David Chu's Restaurant Bistro is a web application designed to provide an interactive online presence for the bistro. The website enables customers to view the restaurant's menu, explore various sections, and enjoy a seamless browsing experience. This project was a milestone project for my certification at Johns Hopkins University in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it showcases modern web design practices along with interactive functionality.

## Features

- **Responsive Menu Display:**  
  Showcase the restaurant’s menu with clear categories and attractive design.
  
- **Interactive User Experience:**  
  Includes dynamic JavaScript components to enhance user interaction, such as greeting messages and animated transitions.
  
- **Modular Structure:**  
  The project is divided into different solution modules (mod2, mod3, mod4, and mod5), allowing for organized development and testing of various features.
  
- **Modern Styling:**  
  Utilizes Bootstrap along with custom CSS for a responsive and professional layout.
  
- **Reusable Code Snippets:**  
  Contains HTML snippets to manage common sections like category titles, menu items, and home page components.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5 & CSS3:** For structuring and styling the website.
- **JavaScript:** For dynamic behavior and interactive elements.
- **Bootstrap:** For responsive design and pre-built styling components.
- **Modular Approach:** The project is divided into multiple solution folders (mod2_solution, mod3_solution, mod4_solution, mod5_solution) for different aspects of the design and functionality.
